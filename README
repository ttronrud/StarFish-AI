SFAI Library and Console Program:

This project is split into two segments - the SFAI DLL and the SFAIC console app used to test the library.

This project requires the frugally-deep project downloaded from vcpkg.

Instructions:
1. Download the vcpkg repo with git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
2. Run the bootstrap-vcpkg.bat file inside the vcpkg directory
3. Install the fdeep package with: vcpkg install frugally-deep
3.5: Default is x86!! Make sure your project is also x86
4. Point either VS or CLion (or whatever IDE) to the CMake toolchain file: [vcpkg install]\scripts\buildsystems\vcpkg.cmake
5. It should work now!
